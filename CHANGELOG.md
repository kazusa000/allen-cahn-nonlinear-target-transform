## Unreleased

- 保留非线性目标、条件变换和直接收缩前驱报告，移除拆分时复制的其他机制与共享 pilot
  报告；删除内容仍可从 `a987d8e74785` 的 Git 历史恢复。
- 从原综合 Allen--Cahn 实验冻结并独立出非线性目标与条件可逆变换路线。
- Froze the next fresh-split joint experiment around the LMI transform:
  `T_phi(u,e)=T0[e+g_tilde(u,e)-g_tilde(u,0)]`, retaining the full nonlinear
  target and exactly four losses while enforcing global invertibility in
  `T0`-normalized coordinates.
- Froze a validation-only four-mode frequency audit for the three nonlinear-target
  checkpoints: decompose target defect and actual contraction power into `Pi_4`
  and `I-Pi_4` components, evaluate the projected-damping target counterfactually,
  and keep the locked test untouched.
- Implemented the checkpoint frequency-audit entry point with exact formal-metric
  replay, orthogonal defect/power additivity checks, per-case attribution,
  projected-target counterfactuals, and pre-registered pooled decision rules.
- Completed the exact-checkpoint RTX 2060 frequency audit. About 95% of learned
  target-defect loss and 92% of failed-sample negative contraction-power burden
  came from `Pi_4`; projected high-frequency damping improved counterfactual RMS
  by only about 2.1%, so the audit rejected it as the primary next repair.
- Implemented the frozen nonlinear-target joint trainer at `nu=0.005`, three
  sensors, and `n=31`: a spectrally projected conditional residual transform,
  a hard-trust-region constant gain, the exact nonlinear Allen--Cahn target,
  full-chain-rule dynamics, exactly four normalized losses, fresh split seeds,
  validation gates, locked test evaluation, and per-seed checkpoints.
- Reapplied the hard gain and transform projections after float64 validation
  conversion, preventing harmless float32-to-float64 singular-value drift from
  producing a false spectral-bound failure.
- Completed the corrected exact-commit RTX 2060 three-seed formal run. All
  structural invertibility checks and online-error gates passed, but all seeds
  failed the error-nonlinearity, worst-contraction, and target-defect progress
  gates; the locked test therefore remained unevaluated. Recorded the result and
  the baseline-preconditioned nonlinear-transform follow-up hypothesis.
- Drafted the next R5 joint-training plan at `nu=0.005`, three sensors, and
  `n=31`: replace the unjustified linear target with an analytically contractive
  nonlinear Allen--Cahn target, replace `P(u)e` with a spectrally bounded
  conditional invertible residual network, and retain exactly four normalized
  training objectives with validation-locked acceptance gates.
- Completed the exact-commit RTX 2060 `nu=0.005` joint multigrid run. Joint
  `B+T_phi` training reduced validation dynamics-defect RMS on grids 31, 63,
  and 127, but every grid failed the frozen worst-contraction, 25%-RMS, and
  online-no-regression gates; defect and worst margin also worsened with mesh
  refinement, so the mesh-robust classification is false.
- Froze a thesis-focused multigrid follow-up at `nu=0.005`: train only the native
  joint `B+T_phi` model independently on grids 31, 63, and 127, retain fixed LMI
  designs only as per-grid references, and compare validation dynamics and safety
  trends without test evaluation or early grid stopping.
- Added a dedicated `nu=0.005` multigrid runner that restricts every reused design,
  target, rollout, and audit helper to the single frozen viscosity; it trains only
  the native joint model on all three grids and emits per-grid gates plus an explicit
  mesh-trend classification.
- Froze the R5 three-sensor dynamics-joint experiment: six fixed/learned `B`/`T_phi`
  ablations, research-plan stable and continuous-defect losses, an ODE-inspired
  input-direction ablation, validation-only selection, and explicit gates for the
  incremental value of `T_phi` and joint training.
- Implemented the frozen six-row ablation, normalized defect-tail and direct-contraction
  audits, Jacobian/zero-fiber checks, validation-only model selection, locked test/noise
  evaluation, multi-grid expansion gates, checkpointing, and a dedicated command-line
  entry point for exact-commit RTX 2060 execution.
- Completed the exact-commit RTX 2060 coarse-grid run. Learned `T_phi` materially reduced
  held-out target-dynamics defect relative to gain-only training, but the selected joint
  model missed the strict worst-sample contraction, fixed-baseline RMS-improvement, and
  joint-synergy gates; test and finer grids therefore remained locked.

# Changelog

- Planned the R5 observation-injection repair: a five-sensor certified baseline, a two-sensor
  oblique modal injection feasibility gate, nonlinear/noise validation, and a training-only-after-
  feasibility compute policy.
- Added a general causal output-injection observer, unstable-mode observability diagnostics,
  pole-placement/Riccati/LMI modal designs, physical-gain and transient metrics, a five-sensor global
  semidiscrete margin audit, and the paired nonlinear/noise CPU experiment entry point.
- Added bounded low-mode joint training around the LMI output injection and its balanced invertible
  metric transform. The trainer uses direct contraction as the primary loss, target-dynamics defect as
  an auxiliary loss, structural invertibility bounds, on-policy refresh, fourth-mode and near-unobserved
  stress cases, and validation-only model selection before test/noise evaluation.
- Froze a three-configuration validation-only GPU screen so gain-only, balanced-joint, and flexible-
  joint residuals can be selected without test leakage before any multi-grid expansion.
- Regularized the zero-initialized gain-residual norm and added a pre-update finite-gradient gate after
  the first remote smoke exposed an undefined zero-norm derivative.
- Completed the CPU matrix/nonlinear gate and the frozen RTX 2060 joint-training screen. Five evenly
  distributed sensors passed all nine global semidiscrete certificate checks and nonlinear/noise
  validation. The original two sensors were linearly stabilizable with a general output injection, but
  every trained configuration failed both the positive-worst-contraction and nu=0.005 online-
  no-regression gates, so multi-grid expansion and test evaluation remained locked.
- Added a fixed-total-observation-length comparison for three and four sensors. The experiment freezes
  geometry selection on coarse-grid linear diagnostics, audits the three-sensor rank obstruction and
  transformed finite-trajectory contraction separately, selects the smallest qualifying four-sensor
  mass-adjoint gain, and unlocks test trajectories only after all validation gates pass.
- Completed the deterministic three/four-sensor study and an exact independent reproduction. Four
  interior sensors with total observation length 0.20 and mass-adjoint gain 0.50 passed all nine global
  semidiscrete margin checks. Three sensors cannot pass that global rank gate at nu=0.005, but a general
  modal injection passed every declared validation and locked-test transformed-contraction, online, and
  noise gate without GPU training.

- Added the R5 direct transformed-error contraction audit, checkpoint replay, contraction-aware joint
  loss, finite-sample worst-margin diagnostics, and pre-registered GPU training screen.
- Completed the RTX 2060 direct-contraction screen: the selected weight-10 model improved the worst
  validation rate from -0.4810 to -0.4043 while preserving invertibility and online error, but did not
  obtain a positive finite-sample validation margin.

## Unreleased

- Implemented the pre-registered T0-preconditioned conditional invertible residual transform, fresh
  train/validation/test splits, normalized-coordinate nonlinearity gates, and a dedicated joint-training
  entry point while retaining the complete nonlinear target and the original four-term objective.
- Completed the three-seed RTX 2060 run: every seed passed contraction, target-defect, invertibility,
  and online gates, but all failed the frozen normalized nonlinear-in-error gate, so the locked test
  remained untouched.
- Added the R5 low-frequency certificate mode with grid-consistent physical sine projections,
  projected online correction, and separate high-frequency tail/coupling audits.
- Completed the R5 low-frequency/tail three-grid run and independent replay: the high-frequency
  tail remained small, while every low-frequency stability-margin gate failed on validation.
- Added the R5-A Allen–Cahn reference model, discrete energy diagnostic, exact fixed-width local-average observations, and causal constant-gain nudging baseline.
- Added the R5-B local incremental Jacobian/remainder diagnostics and offline causal observer rollout harness.
- Added the R5-C offline certificate interface and fiber/direction/local-invertibility audit.
- Added the R5 pilot formal contract for state/error domains, grids, splits, noise, and compute gates.
- Corrected causal nudging to use the physical mass-adjoint observation injection for cross-grid comparability.
- Added deterministic R5 pilot case generation and an exploratory local baseline sweep tool.
- Added the CPU-only causal state-conditioned linear residual correction fit for R5-D, with a fixed physical-gain safeguard.
- Added the reproducible held-out R5-D smoke runner with physical-error, energy-defect, and measurement-noise diagnostics.
- Added the optional PyTorch R5-E joint correction/certificate GPU pilot runner.
- Added independent R5-F checkpoint replay, baseline comparison, and measurement-noise verification.
- Added the R5 ablation matrix runner for fixed-gain, state-conditioning, certificate, direction,
  and bounded-gate factors.
- Recorded the completed 2060 R5 ablation sweep and its certificate/online-coupling conclusion.
- Added the T--K-style R5 joint trainer that optimizes the discrete stable-target loss through both
  the state-conditioned certificate and the deployable gain network.
- Added the R5 joint dynamics-defect loss, two-sided invertibility loss, and structurally bounded
  state-conditioned nullspace scaling; completed the formal 2060 multi-grid run.
- Corrected the R5 stable target to the research-plan diffusion operator, normalized the discrete
  stable loss, added current-observer trajectory refresh, and added validation-rollout model selection.
- Completed the 2060 screening and formal multi-grid replay for the corrected target; the selected
  observer improved noiseless held-out error on all three grids while the dynamics defect remained open.
- Added the pre-registered R5 dynamics-defect repair screen with mixed trajectory replay, structurally
  invertible Givens nullspace mixing, staged-to-joint training, checkpoint persistence, and split-wise
  defect-distribution audits.
- Added the second-stage T--K structure screen with a bounded triangular observed-to-nullspace shear,
  configurable stable-loss weight, and gain-range ablations after the first repair screen failed its
  pre-registered defect-reduction gate.
- Added separate gain/certificate learning rates, staged certificate-first training, gradient clipping,
  and bounded online-rollout failure handling for the triangular structure screen.
- Added a state-wise trust region and normalized deviation penalty around the initialized correction
  operator to keep the joint observer rollout in its numerically stable neighborhood.
- Added physical mass-adjoint correction variants and selected jointly learned constant positive sensor
  gains for the formal screen, matching the correction-operator form declared in the research plan.
- Removed the triangular transform's non-smooth zero-norm second derivative and added immediate
  non-finite loss/gradient checks after it was found to contaminate preliminary online rollouts.
- Aligned the stage-two constant correction initialization with the frozen gain-0.10 validation
  comparator after the first structure screen exposed an incompatible gain-0.02 trust region.
- Completed the calibrated R5 dynamics-defect repair screen on the RTX 2060; validation defect RMS
  improved by 10.5% but failed the frozen 50% progress gate, so no multi-grid expansion was run.
- Added state-dependent stable targets that retain either the Allen--Cahn nonlinear increment or its
  current-state Jacobian, with matched conservative decay, split-step target integration, and a
  pre-registered comparison against the existing fixed linear target.
- Completed the RTX 2060 state-dependent-target screen; both nonlinear targets slightly improved
  online reconstruction but increased held-out dynamics defect, so the pre-registered expansion gates
  failed and the route stopped before multi-grid training.
- Added the pre-registered R5 partitioned local-certificate definitions, strict worst-sample stability
  margin, physical overlap neighborhoods, and trajectory-transition audit.
- Added checkpoint replay tooling for per-region defect, contraction, invertibility, online-error,
  physical-overlap, and trajectory-switching audits.
- Completed the RTX 2060 audit on all 48 validation trajectories: no pre-registered region attained a
  positive strict local margin, and the declared horizon contained no phase-dominated samples.
